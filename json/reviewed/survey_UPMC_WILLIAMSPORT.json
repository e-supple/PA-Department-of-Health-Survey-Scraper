Further review of documentation revealed, at approximately 1945, staff found MR1 lying on the floor with the elastic waist band of the paper scrubs tied around his/her neck. Interview with EMP5 on March 15, 2023, at 0936 confirmed the above documentation and MR1 was on 1:1 observation in the preferred pod for behavioral health patients.  EMP5 further revealed, prior to 1900 on March 13, 2023, PF2 was assigned to provide 1:1 observation of MR1 in room 35.  PF2 left the area at 1859 and handed observation of MR1 over to PF4 because PF2's relief was not going to be available until approximately 1915.  At the time of handoff, PF4 was also providing 1:1 observation for room 36 and a hallway bed in the area.  At 1915 PF3 arrived and assumed 1:1 observation of MR1 and was also assigned responsibility for observation of one of two new patient admissions received at the change of shifts at 1900.  PF3 was observing both MR1 and one of the new admissions from the hall outside the side-by-side rooms.  Due to the new patient admission's escalating behaviors, PF3 left the hall and entered that patient's room, leaving MR1 unobserved.  At approximately 1945, PF4 walked by the video monitoring screen and observed MR1 on the floor.  PF4 notified PF1 who found MR1 on the floor with the elastic waist band of the paper scrubs tied around his/her neck. Review on March 15, 2023, of the ED nursing staff schedules for February 26, 2023 - March 15, 2023, revealed no concerns.  Interview with EMP5, on March 15, 2023, at 1500, confirmed the ED is staffed according to the staffing plan, but additional staff may be necessary to provide 1:1 patient observation.  Staff members are assigned as needed and addition staff may be pulled from staff trained for 1:1 patient observation from other units. EMP5 confirmed staff are utilized from numerous areas in the facility, i.e., nursing units.  2.

The Flow Map defines an escalation process that will start with a phone call to the Administrator on Duty if not able to get covered by the ED Charge Nurse. The Flow Map highlights that any qualified staff member must be temporarily assigned to sit 1:1 with the patient until a permanent sitter can be assigned. o The Clinical Directors reviewed the flow map with all ED Clinicians, ED Charge Nurse's, Unit Directors, and AOD's that were in house on March 15th, 2023, who signed off on it immediately. o Remaining ED Clinicians, ED Charge Nurse's, Unit Directors, and AOD's were educated by the Clinical Directors or Designees prior to the start of their next scheduled shift.

Psychiatric Care Attendant: Provides constant observation or special constant observation to assigned suicidal or behavioral health patients under the direction of the RN/LPN, physician, or provider with prescriptive authority. The Psychiatric Care Attendant will have limited direct care responsibilities so that the patient remains in direct eyesight or, as ordered, within arm's reach at all times. As a result, the Psychiatric Care Attendant may not complete other care or ADLs for the patient that would require the Psychiatric Care Attendant to leave the room (such as going into the patient's bathroom) or turn their back on the patient. ... \"1.
