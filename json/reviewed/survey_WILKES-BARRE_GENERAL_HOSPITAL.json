The oxygen therapy protocol policy was adjusted to reflect the inclusion of nursing to further clarify the process relating to oxygen therapy titration and adjustment for transportation.  The pulmonary section approved the changes on Monday, October 9, 2023 and forwarded to the Medical Executive Committee (MEC) for approval.  The MEC approved the changes on October 10, 2023.  The MEC requested the information technology department add the oxygen protocol to any oxygen order entered by providers at the facility as a part of the order facilitating the enacting of the protocol as intended per the policy.

Interview with EMP5 on September 28, 2023, at approximately 1300, confirmed there was no physician order to titrate oxygen on MR1 from Airvo to 15 L to transport to ultrasound.  Plan of Correction - To be completed: 11/12/2023The Chief Nursing Officer is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the plan of correction and the monitoring of the same.The facility's Chief Executive Officer,Chief Nursing Officer and Chief QualityOfficer created a radiology policy inconsultation with the Director ofRadiology and the Chief, RadiologySection outlining the expectation that all emergency and inpatients havingimaging studies will be supervised byhospital staff trained in basic lifesupport at all times, including in theholding area, until return to their patient room.  Immediate education, in the form of a read and sign, on the new policy was implemented to include all clinical staff with direct patient care responsibilities ex: radiology, transportation and nursing.Direct observation rounding will beimmediately performed by theRadiology director or designee, theChief Nursing Officer, the nursingsupervisor, and Chief Quality Officer toensure compliance with the new policy.All failures to adhere to the policy will be reviewed. A monthly report of the results of the audits will be presented to the Patient Safety Committee on a monthly basis until compliance is 100% for three consecutive months.The facility's Chief Nursing Officer, Chief Quality Officer and Respiratory Therapy Director reviewed the Oxygen Therapy Protocol Policy and High Flow Nasal Cannula Policy on October 6, 2023 to discuss changes to the policies.  The oxygen therapy protocol policy was adjusted to reflect the inclusion of nursing to further clarify the process relating to oxygen therapy titration and adjustment for transportation.  The pulmonary section approved the changes on Monday, October 9, 2023 and forwarded to the Medical Executive Committee (MEC) for approval.  The MEC approved the changes on October 10, 2023.  The MEC requested the information technology department add the oxygen protocol to any oxygen order entered by providers at the facility as a part of the order facilitating the enacting of the protocol as intended per the policy. The nursing and respiratory therapy staff will be educated on the policy changes and changes to the oxygen orders, with an emphasis on validating orders from providers, via read and sign no later than November 12, 2023 or before the start of their next work shift if after November 12, 2023.  The medical staff will be educated on the changes to the oxygen orders reflecting the oxygen protocol as per MEC request no later than November 12, 2023 via read receipt of an email memo. Weekly audits of medical records will be performed by the Respiratory Therapy director or designee, the Chief Nursing Officer, the nursing supervisor, and Chief Quality Officer to ensure compliance with the policy. All failures to adhere to the policy will be reviewed and addressed through re-education or the disciplinary process as appropriate.  A report of the results of the audits will be presented to the Patient Safety Committee on a monthly basis until compliance is 100% for three consecutive months.  All data reported in the Patient Safety Committee is also reviewed at the Medical Executive Committee and by the Board of Trustees. 482.13(c)(2) STANDARD PATIENT RIGHTS: CARE IN SAFE SETTING:The patient has the right to receive care in a safe setting.Observations:Based on review of facility documents, staff interview, and review of a medical record (MR1), it was determined the facility failed to ensure a patient that was on 15 liters of oxygen via a non-rebreather mask via a portable oxygen tank and transferred to radiology to have an ultrasound procedure was monitored by staff after being placed in the radiology holding area awaiting transport back to the nursing unit for one of one medical record reviewed (MR1).Findings include:Review on September 27, 2023, of facility policy, \"Patient's Bill of Rights,\" revised April 23, 2023, revealed \"Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to delineate the Patient's Bill of Rights.

None was provided.Interview with EMP1 on September 27, 2023, at approximately 1115, revealed there was no policy related to monitoring a patient that is on 15 liters of oxygen via a non-rebreather mask via a portable oxygen tank in the radiology holding area awaiting transport back to the nursing unit.Review on September 27, 2023, of MR1 revealed the patient was admitted to the facility on September 20, 2023, with a non-ST elevation (NSTEMI). A routine ultrasound retroperitoneal kidney was ordered on September 23, 2023. Nursing documentation by EMP17 dated September 24, 2023, at 1854 revealed MR1 was sent to ultrasound on a non-rebreather on 15 liters of oxygen. The patient oxygen saturation was 93-94%. The patient was awake and alert. The patient was transferred to a litter by this RN and coworker as well as transport. The patient was transported to ultrasound. This RN was called that the patient was in v-fib (irregular heart rate) on a heart monitor. Ultrasound did not answer the phone. This RN went to the ultrasound department and found the patient on the litter in the waiting area. The non-rebreather was deflated, and the oxygen tank was empty. This RN checked for a pulse; the patient was pulseless and not breathing. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately started. A Code blue was called overhead. The team arrived and began all resuscitation efforts. Further documentation revealed MR1 expired on September 24, 2023, at 1604.
