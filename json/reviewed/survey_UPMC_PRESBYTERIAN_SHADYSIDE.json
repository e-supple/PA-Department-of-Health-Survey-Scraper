The Facility Guidelines Institute for Hospitals (FGI) requires hot water for clinical areas to be 105-120 degrees Farenheit. On August 3, 2023, at 9:00 AM, a tour of  the patient unit 10 West was conducted where the hot water in 2 showers were measured for temperature.  The shower was turned on and was run for approximately 2 minutes prior to collecting a sample in a cup.  The 2 showers each measured 100 degrees farenheit.  This was confirmed by EMP2 at the time of the observation.The above was shared with EMP3 at 9:30 AM.  On August 3, 2023, at 11:55 AM, one shower on patient unit 11West was measured for temperature.  It measured 100 degrees farenheit.  This was confirmed by EMP1.On August 3, 2023, at 12:10 PM a tour of 10 West to reshow-measure the shower temperatures was attempted though all 4 bathrooms occupied, so we walked over to the 10 East patient unit and measured one shower that showed a temperature of 90 degrees.  This was confirmed by EMP2 at the time of the observation.On August 3, 2023, at 12:15 PM, a tour of the 7th floor patient unit was conducted where the hot water to one shower was measured at 96 degrees.  EMP 4 stated staff tell patients to flush the commode a couple of times and the water in the shower gets hotter.  The surveyor had EMP4 flush the commode 3 times and the shower water was re-measured.  The temperature remained at 96 degrees.  This was confirmed by EMP1 and EMP4 at the time of the observation. Plan of Correction - To be completed: 09/22/2023Under the direction of the director of nursing and sr. director regulatory compliance, the following have been or will be taken to correct this deficiency: 1. re-education via a read and sign PowerPoint with unit staff about importance of patients being comfortable with the temperature of shower water, including M-F and after hour numbers to call for plumber to check the water temperature and adjust as needed to maintain compliance with required water temperatures. Read and signs will be completed by 9/22/2023.  2. Shower waters were checked in patient showers for proper temperatures (105-120 degrees Fahrenheit, documenting the temperatures and adjusting diverters as needed. 3. Plumber will conduct weekly temperature readings beginning 8/21/2023 on 5 showers per week, starting on floor 13 and moving down through the patient care floors temperatures will be documented for compliance with 105-120 degrees Fahrenheit and will be adjusted when temperature is out of range at the time identified. Facilities Manager will review weekly audits and report results to Director of Nursing and Director of Quality monthly.  Audits will continue for 60 days or until temperature sensor system is installed.  4. Engineer conducts daily rounds beginning 8/21/2023 and will read hot water heater temperatures and document, Temperatures that are out of range will be adjusted when they are identified. Facilities Manager will review daily audits weekly and report results to Director of Nursing and Director of Quality monthly.  Audits will continue for 60 days or until temperature sensor system is installed.5. Calls to plumber from unit staff regarding a report of cold showers or too hot showers will be addressed as report is received.  Check of water temperature and any correction made will be documented and logged. Facilities Manager will review logged call responses related to water temperatures and report results to Director of Nursing and Director of Quality monthly.  Audits will continue for 60 days or until temperature sensor system is installed. 5.Installation of temperature sensors on heaters will be connected to the automatic logic system and will alarm on higher than permitted and lower than permitted temperatures on the main system. Completion expected by 10/1/2023.PUH/SHY campuses will be exempt for this plan of correction due to the below explanation of the water system at these campuses which is different than what is utilized at WPH. In PUH/SHY, the mixing valves are an integral part of the exposed control handle in the shower.  Those devices provide the ability for the users to adjust the temperature from full hot, 120 degrees, to full cold which would be the incoming cold water temperature.  To avoid the potential for scalding, all heaters are set to maintain 120 degree which would be the highest temperature the patients could be exposed to.  Part of our daily rounds is to log the temperatures at the heaters to confirm the temperatures are correct.Additionally, all heaters have electronic sensors attached to them that will set off a remote signal if the temperature rises above the alarm set point, 125-130 degrees. 153.1 (a) LICENSURE MINIMUM STANDARDS: 153.1  Minimum standards (a) Hospital construction shall be  \nin accordance with the standards set  \nforth in the latest edition of the  \nDepartment of Health and Human  \nServices handbook, Minimum  \nRequirements of Construction and  \nEquipment for Hospital and Medical  \nFacilities, DHHS Publication No. (HRA)  \n14500 Regulations, published under  \nTitle VI of the Public Health Service  \nAct referred to as \"HHS Requirements,\"  \nexcept as modified in this chapter.
