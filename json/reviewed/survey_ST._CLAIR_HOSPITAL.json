This was followed up by placing a sign on the shower door indicating this information for both staff & patients to see.  An email was also sent out to all Behavioral Health Department Staff on 9/5/2023 stating, \"ONLY ONE PERSON AT A TIME WILL BE ALLOWED IN THE 4W SHOWER ROOM UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.\"Specific written shower guidelines were developed and are indicated below:1.\tOnly one patient is permitted in the 4 West shower area at a time.2.\tPatients may shower during the designated time frames of 7am to 9am and 7pm to 9pm daily. Exceptions may be made for extenuating circumstances.3.\tStaff will escort the patient to the shower and lock the door following the patient entering the shower room.4.\tStaff will educate the patient that if they open the shower room door at any time, it cannot be re-locked from the interior.

Patients can exit the shower, but no one can enter from the outside.\"On 09/06/2023, a review of the complaint and grievances log revealed a report made on 09/02/2023, at approximately 7:00am, that in the evening of 09/01/2023, a female patient (MR1) heard a knock on the shower stall door, thought it was a staff member and opened the shower door.  According to the report, the female patient stated that a male patient (MR2) \"had come into my shower.\"  A review of the video recording of the shower area on the date and time of the above incident revealed the following: On 09/01/2023, at 7:36 PM, EMP11 unlocked the shower ante room for a male patient (MR2) but did not accompany MR2 (to shower #3) to lock the shower for the patient.On 09/01/2023, at 7:39 PM, EMP12 walked MR1 past shower room ante door into the  area (to shower #2).  On 09/07/2023, at 12:05pm, EMP3 acknowledged that the correct process did not occur when EMP11 opened the door for MR2, which indicated the shower was not locked.Multiple requests were made for written policies, procedures, protocols, processes, and/or staff education that would ensure safety and privacy for patients while showering on the behavioral health unit (since males and females utilize the same shower area). On 09/07/2023, at 12:05pm, EMP3 confirmed there were no written shower protocols or  policies/procedures for showers on the behavioral health unit.  Plan of Correction - To be completed: 11/24/2023The quality of care and the safety of patients are core values of St. Clair Hospital and safety is what patients, families, staff, and the public expect of our organization. To improve patient safety in the 4 West Behavioral Health Department shower area and ensure a reliable process without variation is achieved and maintained, the following actions will be implemented.After the sexual assault allegation was made on 9/2/23 and to ensure patient safety, staff received immediate instruction to only allow one person to shower at a time.  This was followed up by placing a sign on the shower door indicating this information for both staff & patients to see.  An email was also sent out to all Behavioral Health Department Staff on 9/5/2023 stating, \"ONLY ONE PERSON AT A TIME WILL BE ALLOWED IN THE 4W SHOWER ROOM UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.\"Specific written shower guidelines were developed and are indicated below:1.\tOnly one patient is permitted in the 4 West shower area at a time.2.\tPatients may shower during the designated time frames of 7am to 9am and 7pm to 9pm daily. Exceptions may be made for extenuating circumstances.3.\tStaff will escort the patient to the shower and lock the door following the patient entering the shower room.4.\tStaff will educate the patient that if they open the shower room door at any time, it cannot be re-locked from the interior. This communication will continue until the locks are changed by Plant Operations to allow this feature. However, the anteroom door to the shower area will remain locked and only staff will be entering while the patient is in the shower. 5.\tThe patient will be rounded on every 15 minutes while in the shower room. All Behavioral Health Department staff will be educated on the formalized shower guidelines by 11/3/23 and will be required to verbalize the process and demonstrate locking and unlocking of the shower room doors. Compliance observations of the shower guidelines will begin on 11/6/23 and will include ensuring only one patient is in the shower area at a time and that the door is locked for the patient's safety.  Five observations will be conducted weekly covering both shower time frames until 3 consecutive months of 100% is maintained. Thereafter, random observations will be conducted to ensure sustained compliance. The Director of Behavioral Health Services is responsible for implementation and monitoring of this plan."

Compliance of the above will be monitored until 90% or greater is maintained for three consecutive months.Results of compliance will be shared at the monthly Patent Safety Committee Meeting and forwarded to the Governing Board.Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS):The Emergency Department Director and Emergency Department Supervisor conducted staff meetings on 6/29/23 and 6/30/23 addressing how to appropriately assess a patient for suicidal ideations utilizing the C-SSRS screening tool imbedded in the ED Triage Note. They also reviewed when there is a discrepancy of the patient's presenting complaint/symptoms or documented history that the \"Discrepancy of Patient Statement and History\" box should be checked.  This will automatically place the patient at high risk for harm to self or others and populate the appropriate interventions until a further assessment can be conducted.During review of the electronic C-SSRS screening tool, it was noted when the \"Discrepancy of Patient Statement and History\" box was chosen it kept the patient at low risk for harm to self or others. An Information Technology (IT) Customer Service Request (CSR) was entered on 6/30/23 asking the IT Department to review the screening tool to make sure, when the \"Discrepancy of Patient Statement and History\" box is chosen it scores the patient as high risk.The Director or Supervisor of the Emergency Department will conduct a monthly random sample review of ten mental health ED admission medical records to ensure the C-SSRS is entered appropriately in the ED Triage Note and if the \"Discrepancy of Patient Statement and History\" box is checked, it identifies the patient as High Risk.
