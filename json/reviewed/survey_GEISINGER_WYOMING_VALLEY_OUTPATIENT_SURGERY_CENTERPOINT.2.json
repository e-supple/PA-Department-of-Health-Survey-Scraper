The OSCP medical director will meet 1:1 with any provider identified as noncompliant for education. To decrease the potential of future incidents, an electronic communication was developed and dispersed to all clinical staff within the health system on the importance of proper documentation. The communication included a review of current disclosure guidelines. The electronic communication was dispersed to all medical staff within the healthcare system. The information is also to be reviewed at system service line staff meetings and patient safety committee. 555.24 (c) LICENSURE Surgical Services - Postoperative Care: 555.24  Postoperative Care\t(c)  Patients in whom a complication is known or suspected to have occurred during or after the performance of a surgical procedure shall be informed of the condition and arrangements made for treatment of the complication. In the event of an admission  to an inpatient facility, a summary of care given in the ASF concerning the suspected complication shall accompany the patient. Observations:Based on review of facility documents, medical record (MR) and staff interview (EMP), it was determined the facility failed to ensure a physician disclosed the use of ChloraPrep surgical prep on a patient with a documented severe allergy for one of one appliable medical record reviewed (MR1). Findings include:A request was made of EMP1, EMP2 and EMP3 for a facility policy / procedure / protocol / or guideline medical staff would follow regarding the disclosure of harm or potential harm to a patient that occurs pre-operatively, intraoperatively, and post operatively. None was provided.Review on December 21, 2023, of the facility's \"Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center Bylaws of the Medical Staff,\" last approved by the Board of Directors on September 21, 2022, revealed \"... Article II Purpose and Responsibilities ... Section 2.2 Responsibilities ... The responsibilities of the Medical Staff are: (a) to account for the professional performance, ethical conduct and appropriateness of patient care rendered by all Practitioners ...\"  Review on December 21, 2023, of the facility's \"GWV Rules and Regulations for use of the Medical Record,\" last approved by the Medical Executive Committee on May 10, 2023, revealed \"GWV Rules and Regulations for use of the Medical Record ... XII. Operative / Procedure Reports An operative/procedure report should include date of procedure, description of procedure, a preoperative diagnosis, post operative diagnosis, name of procedure, name of primary surgeon and assistants, type of anesthesia, drains, estimated blood loss, specimens removed, disposition of each specimen, complications, condition of patient, and signature by the surgeon who performed the surgery/procedure. ...\"Interview with EMP1 and EMP2 on December 20, 2023, at 1500 revealed it is the physician's responsibility to notify the patient and / or responsible party regarding harm or potential harm to a patient that occurs pre-operatively, intraoperatively, and post operatively.Review of MR1 on December 20, 2023, revealed documentation by CF1, CF2, EMP2 and EMP6 indicating this patient's allergy to ChloraPrep causing severe blistering.Interview with EMP1 and EMP2 on December 21, 2023, at approximately 1015 confirmed CF1, CF2, EMP2 and EMP6 were operating room (OR) staff present in the room for MR1's prep of this patient's surgical site and for MR1's surgical procedure. Review of MR1 on December 20, 2023, revealed this patient presented to Geisinger Wyoming Valley Centerpoint for a scheduled Arthroscopically Aided ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament - a structure that stabilizes the knee joint and prevents forward movement) surgical procedure of the left knee on September 6, 2023, at 1007.  Further review revealed EMP6 completed a surgical scrub with ChloraPrep to MR1's left knee.There was no documentation in MR1 indicating CF1 disclosed the use of ChloraPrep surgical prep on this patient to the patient or this patient's responsible party. Interview with EMP1, EMP2, EMP3 and EMP4 on December 21, 2023, at approximately 0945 confirmed the above information. Review of MR1 on December 20, 2023, revealed this patient presented to an Outside Hospital (OSH) Emergency Department (ED) on September 9, 2023, with complaint of large fluid filled blisters located around the incision sites and had multiple blisters already erupted with clear / yellow fluid draining from the erupted blisters. MR1 was treated with intravenous Decadron (a medication that reduces swelling and to treat severe allergic reactions) 10 milligrams (mg) / Milliliter (ml) at 1517 and an order to take Benadryl orally when at home.Interview with EMP1, EMP2, EMP3 and EMP4 on December 21, 2023, at approximately 0950 confirmed the above information. Review of MR1 on December 21, 2023, revealed an addendum made by CF1 on September 15, 2023, at 1324 indicating after positioning the patient and leaving the room to scrub, OR nursing inadvertently applied ChloraPrep to the operative extremity despite a previous allergy and blister reaction. MR1 was treated with intravenous Decadron (a medication that reduces swelling and severe allergic reactions) 10 milligrams (mg) / Milliliter (ml) at 1517 and an order to take Benadryl orally when at home. Interview with EMP1, EMP2, EMP3 and EMP4 on December 21, 2023, at approximately 1000 confirmed the above information. Cross reference553.12 (b)(7) Implementation 555.1 Medical Staff Principle Plan of Correction - To be completed: 02/01/2024The facility medical director is responsible for this action plan. On 12-28-2023 facility and system leadership met to review the disclosure process. The team discussed and reviewed the Disclosure of Adverse Events and Errors: Guidelines. The clinical staff will be educated on the current guidelines by January 31, 2024. Per current guideline, a healthcare provider will disclose when a known allergen is given or applied and document the patient response.The medical director of the Outpatient Surgical CenterPoint will be notified of any incidents concerning known allergens given to or applied to patients identified via the current electronic reporting system. The identified chart will be audited to ensure the disclosure to patient was completed and documented correctly. The audit will continue for three months until 100% compliance is maintained. The OSCP medical director will meet 1:1 with any provider identified as noncompliant for education.
