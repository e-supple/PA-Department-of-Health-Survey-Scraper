Main Campus Emergency Department (ED) medication preparation room and a visible signal was installed at the ED \"Green Zone\" corridor intersection to rectify the 2018 FGI Guidelines non-compliance. A review of nurse call compliance including staff drills will occur in all three Emergency Departments on the TUH Inc. license: Main Campus, Jeanes Campus, Episcopal Campus by July 15, 2023.To prevent future non-compliance with nurse call bells, all construction projects will be surveyed for nurse call by the Facilities and Regulatory teams prior to any request for a Pennsylvania Department of Health Division of Acute and Ambulatory Care occupancy survey. The nurse call review will be documented and filed and available to a surveyor upon request.Sustainability is identified through the results of monitoring or auditing for the below data elements. When the results do not meet the benchmark, additional actions are implemented using the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) performance improvement process. Results are re-monitored or re-audited. Remediation with individuals is conducted when an issue is identified.The Vice President of Facilities and/or his designee will audit 100% of construction projects for proof of a compliant nurse call survey within 90 days of written receipt of approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Health Division of Safety Inspection and prior to any requests for a Pennsylvania Department of Health Division of Acute and Ambulatory Care occupancy survey.
