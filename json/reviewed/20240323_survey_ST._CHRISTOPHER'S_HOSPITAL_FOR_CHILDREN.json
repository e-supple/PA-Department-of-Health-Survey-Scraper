This will occur by 1/19/2023. Room M2-14F is officially designated as a sanctioned storage room. The sterile items found in the room at the time of survey have been extracted ensuring the room retains its original purpose as a dedicated space for non-sterile storage. To reinforce this distinction, a sign will be affixed to the door, explicitly indicating that the room is exclusively reserved for storage of equipment/non-sterile items, and sterile supplies are strictly prohibited. A hospital-grade temperature and humidity monitor will be placed in the room and will be checked every 12 hours to ensure the temperature is between 68 – 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 30 – 60% humidity. Temperature and humidity will logged every 12 hours and Facilities will be called if the room deviates from these ranges. Operating Room staff will be educated to monitor temperature and humidity and to report to Facilities when out of range. This will be completed by 2/23/2024.The Manufacturer's Instructions for Use will be checked for all supplies and equipment stored in Room M2-14F. Any item that requires a different temperature or humidity range will be moved to a storage area appropriate for that item. To ensure sterile supplies are stored according to manufacturer's instructions for use, the Charge Nurse or their designee will round in clean/non-sterile storage areas daily when patients are having surgical procedures and will discard any items that are not being appropriately stored in the temperature and humidity controlled sterile core. A log will be kept to track compliance. This daily check will continue for 3 months of 100% compliance.All operating room medical equipment will be cleaned and covered with a clear bag by Operating Room staff to protect it from dust and signify its cleanliness. The Charge Nurse or their designee will round in all operating rooms and storage rooms to ensure this practice is maintained daily when patients are having surgical procedures. A log will be kept to track compliance. This daily check will continue for 3 months of 100% compliance.To ensure items sterilized by the Sterile Processing Department (SPD) are labeled with a unique lot control number, SPD staff will do a one time full check of each item in the sterile core. Any item that is not labeled will be reprocessed. This will be complete by 2/16/2024.  Each month SPD Shift Supervisors will check 50 loose instruments in peel packs, 30 trays in blue sterilization wrap, and 100% of labels on surgical sets in rigid containers. This will continue for three months of 100% compliance. Additionally, Operating Room nursing staff will be educated to return to SPD any item that does not have the label with a unique lot control number. This education will be completed by 2/16/2024. A monthly cycle count is conducted in the supply storage room. The cycle count process has been updated to ensure that all items in the storage room have bin numbers which was not previously in place and allowed for items to be missed during cycle counts. Additionally, any item that is not accounted for in the cycle count but is in the storage room will be removed immediately. The Director of Materials Management or their designee will conduct a weekly random audit of at least 35 items to audit this process. The results of the audits will be shared monthly with the Surgical Care Evaluation Committee, the Quality Committee, and the Board of Trustees. The Chief Nursing Officer is ultimately accountable for this plan of correction. 147.2 LICENSURE MAINTENANCE OF SAFETY & SANITATION: 147.2  Maintenance of safety and \nsanitation The hospital shall be equipped, \noperated, and maintained so as to \nsustain its safe and sanitary \ncharacteristics and to minimize all \nhealth hazards in the hospital, for \nthe protection of both patients and \nemployes.

It is essential to strive to ensure that all sterile products, whether sterilized in the facility or purchased from an outside manufacturer, be maintained, and stored in such a way that sterility is maintained until a product is used.  ... Procedure: 1. General Infection Prevention Practices D. Store sterile supplies in a designated supply area that is clean and dry, protected from dust, moisture (acceptable range <60% relative humidity) and temperature extremes (acceptable range <75F)  ... I. Sterile Processing Department (SPD) staff are responsible to label sterilized items and supplies with a unique lot and control number for recall purposes.  ... 5. Clean and Sterile Supplies A. iii Protect from dust/soil, vermin, temperature extremes and moisture contamination, direct airflow from heating, ventilation, or air-conditioning. \"1. An observation tour conducted on November 14, 2023, with EMP 100 in Surgical Suite Room (M2-14f) revealed Sterile Supplies stored without protective covering from dust, dirt and grime: Ten (10) Versa Jet II Hydro surgery System Handpiece (wound debridement device).Two (2) Dehydrated Human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (Skin substitutes that can be placed in a open wound bed).One (1) Plasma Blade (dissection device for cutting and coagulation of soft tissue).  One (1) Fibrin Sealant (surgical formulation used to create a fibrin clot)2. An observation tour conducted on November 14, 2023, with EMP 100 in the Surgical Suite  room (M2-14f ) revealed the following Clean Supplies stored without protective covering from dust, dirt and grime:Three (3) fluid warmers One (1) Ice Slush MachineTwo pair of goggles located on top of  a cart and not in protective cases.On November 15, 2023, a request made to the facility and EMP 100 for the temperature and humidity readings for the Surgical Suite Room (M2-14f) review storage conditions for the sterile and clean supplies  located in the room.. No documentation was provided.An interview conducted on November 15, 2023, with EMP 100 confirmed  Surgical Suite Room (M2-14f ) was not monitored for temperature and humidity.  EMP 100 also confirmed the patient care sterile and clean supplies were not covered at time of observation to prevent the accumulation of dust, dirt and grime.3. An observation tour conducted on November 15, 2023, of  the Sterile Core  revealed the Sterile Packages did not have a label with a unique lot and control numbers for recall purposes.An interview conducted on November 15, 2023, with EMP 102 confirmed the Sterile Packages stored in the Sterile Core was not labeled with a unique lot and control number from SPD (Sterile Processing Department) as per the facility's policy.-----------------Review of the facility policy \"Patient Supplies, Storage, Handling and Expiration\" last revised September 2023, revealed \"Purpose: ...5. Clean and Sterile Supplies...v. Inspect prior to use for tears ...and confirm that the expiration date has not been reached...7. Inventory Management: A. Rotate stock and use earliest dates first. \"4. An observation tour conducted on November 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM with EMP41 in the facility's Supply Storeroom, located on the ground floor revealed the following:Twelve (12) Carbon Dioxide Detector Units with expiration dates of September 20, 2023, and October 25, 2023.An interview conducted on November 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM with EMP41 and EMP33 confirmed the above findings. Plan of Correction - To be completed: 02/29/2024Operating Room Nursing staff, including technicians, will be educated to the policy \"Patient Supplies: Storage, Handling, and Expiration.\" These staff members will be required to attest to receipt of education and understanding. This will occur by 1/19/2023. Room M2-14F is officially designated as a sanctioned storage room. The sterile items found in the room at the time of survey have been extracted ensuring the room retains its original purpose as a dedicated space for non-sterile storage. To reinforce this distinction, a sign will be affixed to the door, explicitly indicating that the room is exclusively reserved for storage of equipment/non-sterile items, and sterile supplies are strictly prohibited. A hospital-grade temperature and humidity monitor will be placed in the room and will be checked every 12 hours to ensure the temperature is between 68 – 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 30 – 60% humidity. Temperature and humidity will logged every 12 hours and Facilities will be called if the room deviates from these ranges. Operating Room staff will be educated to monitor temperature and humidity and to report to Facilities when out of range. This will be completed by 2/23/2024.The Manufacturer's Instructions for Use will be checked for all supplies and equipment stored in Room M2-14F. Any item that requires a different temperature or humidity range will be moved to a storage area appropriate for that item. To ensure sterile supplies are stored according to manufacturer's instructions for use, the Charge Nurse or their designee will round in clean/non-sterile storage areas daily when patients are having surgical procedures and will discard any items that are not being appropriately stored in the temperature and humidity controlled sterile core. A log will be kept to track compliance. This daily check will continue for 3 months of 100% compliance.All operating room medical equipment will be cleaned and covered with a clear bag by Operating Room staff to protect it from dust and signify its cleanliness. The Charge Nurse or their designee will round in all operating rooms and storage rooms to ensure this practice is maintained daily when patients are having surgical procedures. A log will be kept to track compliance. This daily check will continue for 3 months of 100% compliance.To ensure items sterilized by the Sterile Processing Department (SPD) are labeled with a unique lot control number, SPD staff will do a one time full check of each item in the sterile core. Any item that is not labeled will be reprocessed. This will be complete by 2/16/2024.  Each month SPD Shift Supervisors will check 50 loose instruments in peel packs, 30 trays in blue sterilization wrap, and 100% of labels on surgical sets in rigid containers. This will continue for three months of 100% compliance. Additionally, Operating Room nursing staff will be educated to return to SPD any item that does not have the label with a unique lot control number. This education will be completed by 2/16/2024. A monthly cycle count is conducted in the supply storage room. The cycle count process has been updated to ensure that all items in the storage room have bin numbers which was not previously in place and allowed for items to be missed during cycle counts. Additionally, any item that is not accounted for in the cycle count but is in the storage room will be removed immediately. The Director of Materials Management or their designee will conduct a weekly random audit of at least 35 items to audit this process. The results of the audits will be shared monthly with the Surgical Care Evaluation Committee, the Quality Committee, and the Board of Trustees. The Chief Nursing Officer is ultimately accountable for this plan of correction."
