If a new location is determined to be a better alternative, all requirements of the 2022 FGI Guidelines will be met prior to requesting an occupancy.   2.  PHPH Regulatory Leaders and PH DuBois Regulatory Leaders have developed an \"Occupancy Checklist\" to include FGI Guidelines to assist in pre-occupancy assessments.  Prior to each request to DAAC for occupancy, a walk-through of each space will be conducted utilizing the checklist.  3.  PHPN Regulatory Leaders will be re-educated on appropriate DOH occupancy requirements by the System Director of Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance, or designee, to include the importance of assuring all 2018/2022 FGI guidelines are met prior to occupancy inspection by September 1, 2023.  4.

All behavioral health patients who are treated in the emergency department and who are under constant visual observation per physician orders will treated in the following process:a.  escorted to Holding Room 1 or Holding Room 2, if available or alternate safe treatment roomb.  security/designee will screen the patient with the metal detector device (wand), nursing staff, if needed with the assistance of the security/police, will disrobe the patient and patient will be given paper scrubs to wearc.  patient belongings are removed from the room and placed in a belongings bag; belongings are secured in the main nurses' station in the locked cupboard; belongings are not returned to the patient during visitd.  Nurse caring for the patient will initiate a sitter. The sitter will be present in the anteroom (when utilizing the holding rooms) with visual observation (1:1) on the patient at all times. Observation record, ER-44, will be completed with 15 minute checks.e.  security/designee will be located at the Fire/Exit door when visual observation (1:1) is ordered. Once the delayed egress hardware for this door is appropriately approved by Department of Health, the additional person sitting as this door will no longer be required.3.  Rounding will be conducted on behavioral health patients hourly by the charge nurse. The nurse assigned to Behavioral Health patients ordered 1:1 visual observation will notify charge nurse and document notification in the medical record under ED Adult Systems Assessment – Clinical Progress notes.  Hourly rounds will review the sitters' observation record to assure that the observation record is being completed, confirm proper environment and that patient is in paper scrubs. The charge nurse will utilize the ED-044B form to document the hourly rounding.  If the charge nurse is also the assigned nurse to a particular patient on 1:1 visual observation, the clinical note will not have an indication that the charge nurse was notified.  The charge nurse will additionally verify physician orders of a 1:1 observation, which automatically populates on the tracking board.  Once the tracking board populates, the charge nurse will verify that the 1:1 order was executed.  All ED nurses will be re-educated by the Director of Patient Services and the Supervisor of the Emergency Department on the process by September 29, 2023 and staff will sign a \"sign off\" sheet verifying education.    4.  A Code walker drill will be conducted quarterly for one year beginning with the third quarter of 2023 to ensure staff are properly implementing elopement initiations.  De-briefing will occur after each drill to discuss the outcomes.  In at least two drills, the \"patient\" will successfully elope to ensure staff are following the proper protocol to notify police of the elopement and provide any homicidal specific details to authorities.  The results of each drill will be reported to the Safety Excellence Steering Committee.  5.  Audits of 100% of behavioral health patients began on June 23, 2023 by the Director of Patient Services/designee.  Audits will continue, reviewing 15 records per month by the Director of Patient Services or designee until 3 consecutive months of 100% compliance is achieved.  The audit tool was created to include: medical record number, date and time, security and sitter present, documentation of charge nurse notification of 1:1, room secure, patients screened with metal detector, belongings removed and secured in locked cabinet, charge nurse hourly rounding completed, and ED-44 Observation record completed, and patients' rights and responsibilities communicated to the patient. Audit findings will be presented to the Safety Excellence Steering Committee beginning September 2023. Minutes of the meeting will verify compliance. 6.  Non-compliance with action plan/policies will be followed up by the Director of Patient Services/designee following the Progressive Discipline Policy.7.  The President of the organization has the ultimate responsibility for the completion of this plan of correction. 482.13 CONDITION PATIENT RIGHTS: A hospital must protect and promote each patient's rights.
